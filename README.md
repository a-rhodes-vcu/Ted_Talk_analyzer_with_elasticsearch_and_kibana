<h5>This project explores ted talk transcripts and other video information using Natural Language Processing (NLP), elasticsearch and Kibana. After the transcripts are proccessed they are loaded as a pickle file into an elasticsearch database. Then a Kibana dashboard is used to visualize the database. The ted talk dataset was downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks and an NLP tutorial used is here: https://github.com/1fmusic/tedTalkRecommender/blob/master/README.md. </h5>
